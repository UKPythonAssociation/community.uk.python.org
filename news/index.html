<h3>Announcing the UK Python Association</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/07/25/announcing-the-ukpa/">25th July 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>The PyCon UK committee have recently registered the the
<a href="http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1173471">UK Python Association</a>
as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_incorporated_organisation">Charitable Incorporated Organisation</a>
with the Charity Commission.</p>

<p>The UKPA is a membership organisation, and in the first instance, anybody who attends PyCon UK 2017 is entitled to membership.
For now, membership entitles you to vote to elect the organisation's trustees.
You can indicate that you would like to join the UKPA when you <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/tickets/">buy a ticket for the conference</a>,
or if you already have a ticket, when you <a href="https://hq.pyconuk.org/profile/">fill out your profile</a>.</p>

<p>We are looking to elect up to six trustees for the UKPA at the first AGM on the Saturday of the conference.
The trustees will be responsible for the charity's management and administration,
and will be responsible for appointing a chair for PyCon UK 2018.</p>

<p>If you would like to put yourself forward for election as trustee,
please complete the <a href="https://hq.pyconuk.org/ukpa/nominations/new/">nomination form</a>
by Thursday 12th October.</p>

<p>You can read more about the decision-making behind the formation of the UKPA

<h3>Could you edit UK Python News?</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/06/28/could-you-edit-uk-python-news/">28th June 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From Peter Inglesby, PyCon UK chair:</p>

<p>"I've been producing UK Python News since last autumn,
and it's now in a state where I'd be happy to hand it over to somebody else.</p>

<p>There are number of different aspects to the work:</p>

<ul>
<li>collecting events happening around the country (although this is fairly well automated now)</li>
<li>keeping an eye out for interesting news items</li>
<li>improving the automation to gather events and collate the website and newsletter</li>
<li>enhancing the design of the website</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like to chat more about what taking on any of this would involve,
please drop me a line at peter.inglesby@gmail.com."</p>

<h3>PyCon UK tickets, talks, and sponsorship</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/06/23/pyconuk-tickets-talks-sponsorship/">23rd June 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>Following a slight holiday-related hitch,
tickets for PyCon UK 2017 will now go on sale slightly later than planned
on July 2nd on the <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/">conference website</a>.</p>

<p>We'll also open the <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/cfp/">Call for Participation</a> then,
and we'd like to see proposals of all sorts for talks, workshops, posters — or anything else —
from all parts of the community.
We're especially interested in proposals from first-time speakers,
and we'll be able to provide mentorship and advice to all speakers who request it.</p>

<p>On the same day, we'll be opening applications for financial assistance,
and we have allocated a significant proportion of our conference budget towards
ensuring that attending the conference is as affordable as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, we're also looking for conference sponsors.
Sponsoring the conference is the best way for your company to engage with the UK Python community,
whether you want to recruit Python engineers,
promote your products,
or raise your profile.
Sponsors get free conference tickets,
a space to exhibit during the conference,
promotion online and in this newsletter,
and (for higher-level sponsors) guaranteed space on the programme.
If you're interested, please take a look at our <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/sponsorship/">sponsorship prospectus</a>.</p>
