title: The John Pinner Award
newsletter_month: 2017-10
---
We are pleased to announce that nominations for the first ever
[John Pinner Award](http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/) are open.

We want YOU to nominate people who freely contribute time and effort for the
good of the UK Python community but who generally don't get the sort of
recognition others may enjoy.  To be clear, this award celebrates community
rather than technical endeavours.

Perhaps you can think of that person who quietly organises your local user
group, runs workshops, mentors others online or creates educational resources
for others to re-use. It is the contributions of people like this who we'd like
to celebrate through this award.

You can nominate any number of people and the nomination process is very
simple. Full details can be found [here](http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/).

Get nominating!
