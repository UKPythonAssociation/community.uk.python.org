title: PyData London 2017 Call for Proposals
---

From the PyData London team:

"[PyData London's Call for Proposals](http://pydata.org/london2017/) is open,
and we're seeking talks on data science and data engineering from all levels
(first-timers super welcome through to those with many years of experience).
The conference will run during May 5-7th in central London with 330 attendees.

Topics we'd like to see proposed include data pipelines and storage to solve
data engineering tasks, machine learning and statistics to answer questions,
visualisation to explain results and everything around these topics. For
inspiration see our [schedule from last year](http://pydata.org/london2016/schedule/)
 and the talks that we have at our [monthly meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/).

The Call for Proposals runs until mid-to-late February (closing date to be
confirmed), the earlier you submit the more feedback you'll get and the more
likely you are to be accepted."
