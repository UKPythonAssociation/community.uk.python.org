  <p>Nominations for the 2018 <a href="/john-pinner-award/">John Pinner Award</a> are open.</p>

the UK, and recognises those who freely contribute their time and effort for
the good of the community.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can think of that person who quietly organises your local user
group, runs workshops, mentors others online, or creates educational resources
for others to re-use.  It is the contributions of people like this who we'd
like to celebrate through this award.</p>

<p>You can nominate any number of people and the nomination process is very
simple. Full details can be found <a href="/john-pinner-award/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Changes to the UK Python News mailing list</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2018/05/24/changes-to-the-mailing-list/">24th May 2018</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>The what:</p>

<ul>
<li>We're closing the UK Python News mailing list and starting a new one, which will by operated by the UK Python Association.</li>
<li>We'd like you to sign up to the new one!</li>
<li>You can do so <a href="http://eepurl.com/dv4grb">here</a>.</li>
<li>You'll receive monthly emails with news about the UK Python community, including about PyCon UK.</li>
<li>You can unsubscribe at any time.</li>
<li>The mailing list is operated by MailChimp.</li>
<li>The UKPA will never share your contact details with anybody (apart from MailChimp).</li>
</ul>

<p>The why:</p>

<ul>
<li>We're doing this for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>GDPR (and specifically: we automatically signed up attendees to PyCon UK 2016 to this mailing list, and shouldn't have done (sorry)).</li>
<li>We're slowly transferring the assets of the PyCon UK Society Ltd to the UK Python Association, and we're not quite sure of the best way to transfer a mailing list. You can read more about the UKPA <a href="http://uk.python.org/about/">here</a>.</li>
</ul></li>

<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From Ian Ozsvald (of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/">PyData London</a> fame):</p>

<p>"I run a jobs email list focused on Data Scientist and Data Engineer jobs for
Pythonistas. A jobs email is sent every 2 weeks containing 7-10 jobs, there's a
focus towards London and the jobs reach across the UK and into Western Europe.
Currently there are over 900 people on the list and a set have found new roles
via this list. Advertising companies range from start-ups to the BBC, Cambridge
University and Last.fm. Your email is never shared with anyone else, the list
is controlled by mailchimp so you can unsubscribe at any time.</p>

<p>Here's a quote from one of the list members (Frank is a co-founder of
PyDataBristol).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m very grateful for Ian’s job list as it enabled me to find a Data Science
  job in an interesting and meaningful domain, and furthermore connected me with
  likeminded folk. Strongly recommend. – Frank Kelly, Senior Data Scientist

<h3>Self-driving robot racing competition with the Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/09/09/formula-pi/">9th September 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From Barry Byford:</p>

<p>"<a href="https://www.formulapi.com/">Formula Pi</a> is a racing competition for software
developers to compete against each other to see how good their code is at
controlling a small autonomously vehicle.</p>

<p>The hardware is provided and maintained by the organisers so the vehicles are
identical removing that expense and complexity from competitors. This results
in a series that allows software engineers to compete purely on the
capabilities of their code. Competitors upload their code to vehicles via the
Formula Pi website and the races are streamed live on YouTube.</p>

<p>When competitors register they get access to a simulator for testing their code
as well as some example Python code to get started.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.piborg.org/formulapi-entry-winter2017">Registration</a> for the third
series of Formula Pi is open until 30th Septmber."</p>

<h3>The John Pinner Award</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/09/08/john-pinner-award/">8th September 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>We are pleased to announce that nominations for the first ever
<a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/">John Pinner Award</a> are open.</p>

<p>We want YOU to nominate people who freely contribute time and effort for the
good of the UK Python community but who generally don't get the sort of
recognition others may enjoy.  To be clear, this award celebrates community
rather than technical endeavours.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can think of that person who quietly organises your local user
group, runs workshops, mentors others online or creates educational resources
for others to re-use. It is the contributions of people like this who we'd like
to celebrate through this award.</p>

<p>You can nominate any number of people and the nomination process is very
simple. Full details can be found <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Get nominating!</p>

<h3>PyCon UK 2017 accommodation warning</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/08/30/pyconuk-accommodation-warning/">30th August 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>There are rumours that a heavyweight boxing match may be taking place in Cardiff on the Saturday of PyCon UK,
and so accommodation in the city has been snapped up much more quickly this year than usual.</p>

<p>If you're coming to the conference, <strong>you should book your accommodation now</strong>.
Don’t delay any further!
If you leave it too late, you may find that there is no more affordable accommodation available.</p>

<p>We have set up a <a href="http://pyconukaccommodation.wikia.com/wiki/PyConUKAccommodation_Wiki">wiki</a>
for people to arrange sharing of rooms or rentals,
or for anybody in Cardiff to offer a room in their home.
(We can offer a free conference ticket to anybody in Cardiff who can put up visitors in their home.)</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/accommodation/">accommodation page</a> on our website for more details.</p>

<h3>Django Girls at PyCon UK 2017</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2017/08/07/django-girls-at-pyconuk/">7th August 2017</a></p>
<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From the organisers of Django Girls at PyCon UK:</p>

<p>"Are you female and want to learn how to make websites? Don’t know where to start? We have good news for you! We are holding a <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/django-girls/">one-day workshop at PyCon UK 2017</a> for beginners.  We believe the IT industry will benefit greatly from encouraging more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become one of us - female programmers! </p>

<p>Learning how to code can seem like an impossible task, so a Django Girls workshop at PyCon UK will show 30 programming beginners how it can be done and get them excited about the world of technology.</p>

<p>The Django Girls workshop is a crash course aimed at total beginners. You don’t need to know anything about programming, just bring your own laptop, have a sufficient understanding of English so you’re able to follow our English tutorial and be able to commit to the all-day workshop. You will work through the tutorial in a small group of three attendees and one coach so you’ll be able to do it at your own pace.</p>

<p>Django Girls was born in July 2014 in Berlin and today, Django Girls is a volunteer run organisation with hundreds of people contributing to bring more women to the Python and Django communities. Our goal is to bring more amazing women into the world of technology and increase the diversity in the Django community."</p>

<h3>Could you edit UK Python News?</h3>

<div class="textblock">
  
  <p>From Peter Inglesby, PyCon UK chair:</p>

<p>"I've been producing UK Python News since last autumn,
and it's now in a state where I'd be happy to hand it over to somebody else.</p>

<p>There are number of different aspects to the work:</p>

<ul>
<li>collecting events happening around the country (although this is fairly well automated now)</li>
<li>keeping an eye out for interesting news items</li>
<li>improving the automation to gather events and collate the website and newsletter</li>
<li>enhancing the design of the website</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like to chat more about what taking on any of this would involve,
please drop me a line at peter.inglesby@gmail.com."</p>

from all parts of the community.
We're especially interested in proposals from first-time speakers,
and we'll be able to provide mentorship and advice to all speakers who request it.</p>

<p>On the same day, we'll be opening applications for financial assistance,
and we have allocated a significant proportion of our conference budget towards
ensuring that attending the conference is as affordable as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, we're also looking for conference sponsors.
Sponsoring the conference is the best way for your company to engage with the UK Python community,
whether you want to recruit Python engineers,
promote your products,
or raise your profile.
Sponsors get free conference tickets,
a space to exhibit during the conference,
promotion online and in this newsletter,
and (for higher-level sponsors) guaranteed space on the programme.
If you're interested, please take a look at our <a href="http://2017.pyconuk.org/sponsorship/">sponsorship prospectus</a>.</p>
